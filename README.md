# VAE-Descent
A plain-vanilla Neural Network Architecture built from scratch using only numpy, math and random (+ matplotlib for visualization) !

Current Highlights:
- Neural structure using classes for a more intuitive codebase
- Forward pass and backward pass
- Includes implementation of gradient descent algorithm from scratch (backpropgagation) -- see BackProp(...)

TODOs:
- Batch Normalization 
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Batch Gradient Descent
